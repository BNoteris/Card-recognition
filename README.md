# Card recognition program and blackjack simulator

Program designed to recognize playing cards patterns and simulate a blackjack game

## Usage

to make the program works you'll need to first use the "Fixed image.ipynb" file and set up your templates with screenshots of your cards 
with the same lightning conditions as when you'll play blackjack.
Once you are satisfied with your results you can then hop on the "Camera image.ipynb" file and use the Blackjack snippet to play.
To make  all this easier, I recommend placing your cards on a black background.

## Files

Functions.py contains every functions and classes

Fixed Image.ipynb contains tests and demonstrations of the functions to make them work on a fixed image

Camera image.ipynb contains also the tests and demonstration but for the live camera.

Prompt_logs.md contains all the logs made with Chatgpt
